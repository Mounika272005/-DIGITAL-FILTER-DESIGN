Description:

Objective:
The main objective of this mini-project is to design and simulate a 3-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filter using Verilog HDL. FIR filters are widely used in digital signal processing (DSP) applications for tasks like noise reduction, signal smoothing, and system identification. This project focuses on understanding the structure and behavior of a FIR filter at the register-transfer level (RTL) and implementing it using synchronous digital logic.

The design involves:

Building a 3-tap FIR filter using a shift register for input delay lines.

Multiplying delayed inputs with fixed filter coefficients.

Accumulating the multiplied results to generate the filtered output.

Writing a testbench to verify the functionality and simulate various input sample streams.

Tools Used:
Verilog HDL: Used to write both the FIR filter logic and the simulation testbench.

Icarus Verilog (iverilog): A free Verilog simulator used to compile and run the testbench.

GTKWave: Used to view and analyze waveform output (.vcd file).

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A feature-rich code editor used for writing and organizing the Verilog files.

Applications of FIR Filters:
FIR filters are extensively used in various digital systems such as:

Audio processing: Equalizers, noise reducers, and sound enhancement systems.

Image processing: Smoothing, edge detection, and sharpening filters.

Communication systems: Channel equalization, pulse shaping, and signal recovery.

Biomedical devices: Heart rate monitoring (ECG), EEG filtering, and medical signal analysis.

Radar and sonar systems: Echo suppression and signal modulation.

The simplicity, stability, and linear phase properties of FIR filters make them a preferred choice in many DSP systems.

Conclusion:
This mini project demonstrated how a basic FIR filter can be modeled and tested using Verilog. By simulating and analyzing its output using waveform tools, the behavior and performance of the filter were verified. The project serves as an ideal introduction to DSP hardware design, combining core concepts of digital logic with real-world signal processing techniques.

Future enhancements can include variable coefficients, more taps (higher-order filter), and making the filter programmable via input ports or memory-based coefficient loading.
